# Bayesian Probability

## What is Bayesian Probability?
Bayesian probability interprets probability as a measure of belief or certainty rather than a long-run frequency.

## What is Bayes' rule and how do you use it?
Bayes' rule updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It is defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

## What is a base rate?
The base rate is the overall likelihood of an event occurring, known as the marginal likelihood (P(B)).

## What is a prior?
The prior probability (P(A)) is the initial degree of belief in an event before new evidence is taken into account.

## What is a posterior?
The posterior probability (P(A|B)) is the updated probability of an event after considering new evidence.

## What is a likelihood?
The likelihood (P(B|A)) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
