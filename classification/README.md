# Classification in Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts in machine learning especially Classification and Neural Network. By the end of this project, I will have to be able to explain key terms and methodologies in machine learning without the need for external references.

## Learning Objectives


- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a process used to make predictions.
- **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
- **Prediction**: The output generated by a model based on input data.
- **Node**: A basic unit in a computation graph representing a variable or function.
- **Weight**: A parameter in the model that is adjusted during training to minimize error.
- **Bias**: A parameter that allows the model to fit the data better by shifting the activation function.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions that determine whether a neuron should be activated based on the input.
  - **Sigmoid**: An activation function that maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.
  - **Tanh**: An activation function that maps input values to a range between -1 and 1.
  - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: An activation function that outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.
  - **Softmax**: An activation function used in multiclass classification to convert logits into probabilities.
- **Layer**: A collection of nodes in a neural network.
- **Hidden Layer**: Layers between the input and output layers that help the model learn complex patterns.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes.
- **Loss Function**: A function that measures how well the model's predictions match the actual data.
- **Cost Function**: A function that aggregates the loss over the entire dataset.
- **Forward Propagation**: The process of passing input data through the model to obtain predictions.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by adjusting weights.
- **Back Propagation**: A method for updating weights by calculating the gradient of the loss function.
- **Computation Graph**: A representation of the operations performed in a model.
- **Weights/Bias Initialization**: The process of setting initial values for weights and biases before training.
- **Vectorization**: The process of converting operations to work on vectors instead of scalars for efficiency.
- **Data Splitting**: Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Multiclass Classification**: A classification task where the output can belong to one of three or more classes.
- **One-Hot Vector**: A binary vector representation of categorical data.
- **Encoding/Decoding One-Hot Vectors**: The process of converting categorical data into one-hot vectors and vice versa.
- **Softmax Function**: Used to convert logits into probabilities for multiclass classification.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: A loss function commonly used for classification tasks.
- **Pickling in Python**: The process of serializing and deserializing Python objects.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS** using **Python 3** (version 3.5)

- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should adhere to **pycodestyle** style (version 2.4)
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation:
  - For modules: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
  - For classes: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
  - For functions: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
